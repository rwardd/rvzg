===
Start with microkernel. Implement barebones for basic scheduling and i/o.
Get it running on softcore rv32.
Maybe will move to monolithic design.

todo: everything
- thread creation
	- just do compile time for now
- thread memory
	- tls
	- thread memory arenas?
- thread scheduler
	- most threads should run in ring 0? No syscalls?
	  instead implement a check before calling syscall fns
- timers
	- hardware
	- softare
- atomics
- serial logger
- mempool/arena/slab?
- ipc
	- message queue
	- semaphore
	- mutex
	- queue
- smp?
